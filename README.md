# SysIdCollector

When using the [SysId tool](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/pathplanning/system-identification/introduction.html), our team was having 
difficulties deploying the project code to our robot; it was crashing.

This is a re-implementation of the [Drivetrain sysid-project](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/sysid/tree/main/sysid-projects) 
in Java instead of C++, because, when Java crashes, it prints a stacktrace of where the error occurred.

## Deploying
This tool respects the JSON config format generated by the SysId desktop tool, so the recommended approach would be to:

1. create the desired motor/encoder configuration in the SysId configuration panel
2. deploy the SysId project to the RoboRIO
3. if the robot code fails to start, deploy this project instead

The SysId configuration is deployed to `deploy/config.json` on the RoboRIO, so an alternate approach would be to create the configuration with SysId, and then, instead of deploying the sysid-project to the RoboRIO, save the config file to your machine. You can then copy the `config.json` file onto the RoboRIO using an SCP tool.

## SysId Extensions

### Gyro axis
The SysID tool is currently hardcoded to use the Z axis on a multi-axis gyros. To select another axis, an additional key can be added to the JSON file:
```javascript
  "gyro axis": "X"
```
